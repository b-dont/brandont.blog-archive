# New Years Resolutions 2023

I think I'm making this list just to help hold myself accountable next year. There are _several_ goals I want to make for myself in 2023, so I'll list them out here with a little context.

## Physical Health
Ah, yes, the meme itself. I've gained almost 50 lbs since 2020, and given my preexisting conditions, I think it's time to get my ass off the couch and start taking care of myself, even if it's simple things like going for a couple of walks a day, or the dog park once a week. 

## Better Routines
My partner and I are pretty good at keeping healthy(ish) morning and night routines, but I think I could be doing better. Also isolating some unhealthy habits, like bringing my phone in the bedroom and doom-scrolling before falling asleep, or waking up just before I have to work and not taking a shower until noon.

## Going Out More
My social life has been limited to family gatherings and events, D&D night, and the occasional outing with my partner. I think I need to get out more. 

## Blogging
Yup, more blog posts. My goal is at least once a week, and I'd like to start (and finish!) [100 Days to Offload](https://100daystooffload.com/). That's the goal, at least. I think this will also drive other things, like programming, reading, and my D&D writting, as they can give me subjects to write about.

## Reading
I really put reading on the back-burner this year. I've got a huge bookshelf that's about half full with books I haven't opened yet. 

Short list of the queue:
1. Unfinished Tales - Tolkien
2. All Quiet on the Western Front - Remarque (I never finished it.)
3. Lord Foul's Bane - Donaldson
4. The Conquest of Happiness - Russel

.. and a bunch more I don't want to go grab to list. Just what's on the top of my head. There's probably going to be several other Tolkien works from The Histories of Middle Earth, which I haven't cracked into yet.

## Personal Projects
The never ending story of our lives as computer nerds and programmers. 

1. [Personal Website using Zola](https://codeberg.org/brandont/brandont.dev) - I've put this off for too long, it's at the top of my list next year.
2. Owncloud Instance - I want to stream again, and I don't want it to be on Twitch or YouTube.
3. NextCloud Instance
4. Maybe a home server of some kind for the former two?

## Dungeons & Dragons (and other TTRPGs)
I'd like to get the worldbuilding and wiki done for what I hope to be my second long-term campaign. Another item on this list includes playing/exploring more indie ttrpgs, and solo pen & paper rpgs. There's some awesome stuff over on [Floating Chair Club](https://floatingchair.club/).

I think that's pretty much it. I'll be back to this in a year to see how I did.
