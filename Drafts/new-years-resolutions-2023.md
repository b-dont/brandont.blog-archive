# New Years Resolutions 2023

I think I'm making this list just to help hold myself accountable next year. There are _several_ goals I want to make for myself in 2023, so I'll list them out here with a little context.

## Physical Health
Ah, yes, the meme itself. I've gained almost 50 lbs since 2020, and given my preexisting conditions, I think it's time to get my ass off the couch and start taking care of myself. 

## Reading
I really put reading on the back-burner this year. I've got a huge bookshelf that's about half full with books I haven't opened yet. 

Short list of the queue:
1. Unfinished Tales - Tolkien
2. All Quiet on the Western Front - Remarque (I never finished it.)
3. Lord Foul's Bane - Donaldson
4. The Conquest of Happiness - Russel

.. and a bunch more I don't want to go grab to list. Just what's on the top of my head.

## Personal Projects
The never ending story of our lives as computer nerds and programmers. 

1. [Personal Website using Zola](https://codeberg.org/brandont/brandont.dev) - I've put this off for too long, it's at the top of my list next year.
2. Owncloud Instance - I want to stream again, and I don't want it to be on Twitch or YouTube.
3. NextCloud Instance
4. Maybe a home server of some kind for the former two?
