# The End of my Four Year Dungeons & Dragons Campaign

We did it. We finished a _four year_ Dungeons & Dragons campaign. 

This was my first long-term experience with Dungeons & Dragons. I had played a few one-shot games here and there over the years but never really got into it. Then, like many have done since the rise of [Twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv) in the last 10 years, I was introduced to [Critical Role](https://critrole.com/) and decided to give it another chance. 

### When it all started
My roommate at the time had another friend from work who had much more experience with the game, playing 2nd Edition, 3rd, and 3.5 pretty heavily. We decided to pull together with a couple he knew, and got a party of four plus a DM to play 2nd Edition. I decided to roll a Cleric, and try my hand at a more support-y character. We ran a short dungeon-crawl, murder hobo'd out, and had tons of fun. After that first, short campaign we tried a couple of others, however, like countless groups before us, the party fell apart. I had another set of friends that were still interested in playing, though. This time, I wanted to dive into 5th Edition, and play the game I've been watching Mercer and company crushing on Twitch. I picked up the Dungeon Master's Guide, Player's Handbook, and Monster Manual, and started writting my first campaign. 

### The Good, the bad, and the inspiration
When I started writting the first drafts of my campaign (the lore, the world, ect.), I bought a couple of leather-bound journals to write everything in. They were filled with hand-drawn maps, diagrams, and NPC stat blocks.
