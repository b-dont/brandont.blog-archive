# The End of my Four Year Dungeons & Dragons Campaign

We did it. We finished a _four year_ Dungeons & Dragons campaign. 

This was my first long-term experience with Dungeons & Dragons. I had played a few one-shot games here and there over the years but never really got into it. Then, like many have done since the rise of [Twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv) in the last 10 years, I was introduced to [Critical Role](https://critrole.com/) and decided to give it another chance. 

## When it all started
My roommate at the time had another friend from work who had much more experience with the game in the past, playing 2nd Edition, 3rd, and 3.5 heavily. We decided to pull together with a couple he knew, and get a group going to play 2nd Edition. I decided to roll a Cleric, and try my hand at playing a more support-y character. We ran a short dungeon-crawl, murder hobo'd out, and had tons of fun.
