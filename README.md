# Blog brandont.Blog

This is the public repository for my personal blog at [brandont.blog](https://brandont.blog). It runs on [Blot.im](https://blot.im) with a custom template (it's not _too_ custom, yet, just added my own colors and a couple of `.svg` icons). 

All of the published posts will be available here, as well as any changes I've made to the template or additional pages added to the site. For now, no major changes are planned for either the template or new pages, however I do plan on making some adjustments here and there to give the site my own flavor.
