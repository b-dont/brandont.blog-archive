# A New Website, and A New Outlook

A year ago I made my first website [brandont.dev](https://brandont.dev), a simple portfolio site in Django to showcase all I've been learning in programming and software development since starting my journey in mid-2020. It wasn't very good, of course. Simple, but clunky, and not very much content. I didn't have a reCaptcha for my the email page or anything to subdue the spam bots in my inbox, and the front page was just a picture of my face with a small blurb describing me and my programming aspirations. 

I didn't expect myself to create anything mind-blowing, just something impressive enough to give me some kind of edge in interviews as an aspiring programmer with no professional experience (and to be honest, very little amature experience), and an opportunity to learn new things and create something I'd be proud of. It was a challenge, but very rewarding.

The site has since collapsed. When deploying it, I had not set up any kind of deployment structure, and making changes to the wesite was difficult, tedious, and annoying. I wanted to try and salvage the monster I had created, but in the process, destroyed it. Oh well.

On the bright side, this means I have an opportunity to build a new one from the ground up again, and that got me excited. After landing my first tech job as a sys admin back in December, I've had an opportunity to develop some pretty bitchin' new skills working in professional environments and soaking up all I can in the process. Equiped with a freash set of skills and resources, I'm confident that this time, I can build a much more robust website that can grow and change with my growing and changing skill-set, and better reflect where I'm at in my programming journey. 

### Roadmap, Part I

I spent a little bit of time yesterday ploting out a simple map of my goals overall with the website in the forseeable future. The site will be build on priciples of simplicity, from its design to the deployment structure around it, which is what I'll be starting with. 

[blot.im](https://blot.im), the framework/service that I use for this blog, inspired me to use Git for a simple deployment system, which will be the first task I work on for the project. I've already started laying out how I'll be using git commit changes, save my work remotely, and also push the project to my production environment on a remote VPS.
